First task 01 - I want you to read the book-of-work.json and be mindful of its content its the work which claude code is working on right now it changes - then task 2 with it in mind - I want you to read the file \"code.json\" and then open the source code that the modules point too,  you are to scrutinise and scour the whole code base looking for security issues (think like a hacker OSWAP ++)  when you find a flaw which does not already exist within the RedTeam.json or does not already exist in the book of work.json then add it to BOTH  as new entries following the existing patterns. Use aggressive checkpointing as required. Write in the RedTeam.json a new section when you start to describe what it is you have been asked to do and how much progress you have made. Be verbose in your standard output so you show me here what module/file you're working on, and how many new flaws/bugs/exploits you have found in this session. Expect to crash and have to pick it up from last check point so write yourself some good notes. When you restart I will point you (red team) at red-team.json - now go for it Red Team go get them..",
