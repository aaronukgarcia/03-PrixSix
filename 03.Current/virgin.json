The problem isn't missing features, it's DISCOVERABILITY. Users are abandoning not because the help doesn't exist, but because they can't find it. The fixes are simple (add navigation links) and high-impact. Fix the signposting, and you have a polished, professional, user-friendly F1 prediction platform that works for both experts and complete novices."
